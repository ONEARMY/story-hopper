subtitle: figuring out how to travel sustainable
about: How to travel sustainable? A question that has been on my mind for a long time.. Planes, trains, cars I never know what to choose. I went on the longest train trip in the world. 168 hours in the Transberian express train through Russia with grandma's, a hot water machine and an outside temperature of -25 in Siberia. Good time to do some proper thinking to find an answer. I got it and made 3 commitments for the future :)

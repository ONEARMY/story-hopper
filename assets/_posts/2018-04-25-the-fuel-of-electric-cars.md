title: The fuel of electric cars
subtitle: Zero emissions? Not really..
about: Electric cars are advertised as transport that leaves zero emission. No footprint. Like riding a unicorn. I visited the biggest lithium mine of the world in Chile. This white powder is used for a crucial part. Batteries. But is this stuff any good, how is it mined, does it harm the environment? And what else is needed to manufacture cars?

about: Apparently 1/3 of all the food we humans produce globally goes to waste (I always wonder how they measure this stuff globally, but i’m sure its a lot). Its not only the material that goes to waste, but also the energy that we put into it. We grew it, packed it, shipped it, stored it, etc. For instance all the packaging we produced that comes with it is useless if we humans don’t use it. Feels bad to just throw all of this food out… We wanted to do something more useful with it

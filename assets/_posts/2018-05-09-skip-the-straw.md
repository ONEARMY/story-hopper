title: Skip the straw
subtitle: Tiny stickers that help to reduce our straws
about: I'm very aware plastic straws leave a big scar in our environment. We only use them for a few minutes but they stay on earth for hundreds of years. Most likely when you order a drink it comes with a straw. Its the standard. So even I end up using too many plastic straws. So we've made a little sticker thats helps to resist and change our habits.

about: I always wonder whether fake stuff is worse than the real. Whether the extra amount of money you pay for the originals truly gives a better product. I bought a fake an real Nike shoe and starter wearing them at the same time wherever I went for the last year. Noticeable difference already after a few weeks and in the end one true winner. However the results don't matter. There is a reason why you shouldn't buy fake stuff. ever.

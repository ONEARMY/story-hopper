subtitle: We spend more and more time on te internet, but is this good?
about: here are a lot of them out there, all made from data... Even if they are exactly the same, it uses twice the amount to store it So lets say you post a picture, that takes data. Share that exact same picture on another platform.. Boom double data. Again boom, triple. We easily create more.... So why is all this data a problem? it is all saved digital online right? Thousends of servers in a cooled room without daylight These datacenters are all over the world storing our online data. Running day and night consuming energy. <br> <br>  <strong>here are a lot of them out there, all made from data... </strong>Even if they are exactly the same, it uses twice the amount to store it So lets say you post a picture, that takes data.

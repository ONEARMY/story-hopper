        <p>Seriously, we really do! Listening to people from all over the world. Share something that you have learned, a theory you came up with, something you did that could inspire others. Anything for the better. One simple video can bring a change to the world. (no pressure)</p>

        <h2>Never made a video?</h2>
        <p>We get that, not everyone is a videomaker. That’s why this is still in beta. But that shouldn’t stop us. We love that nowadays everyone basicly has the tools (smartphone camera) and knowledge (youtube tutorial) to make a decent video. It’s a matter of getting started.</p>
